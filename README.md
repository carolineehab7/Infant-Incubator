# 👶🛏️ Infant-Incubator

This project details the development of a **sensor-based system** designed to simulate a **smart infant incubator** for neonatal care.

## 🌟 Key Features

* 🌡️ **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**
  Using the DHT11 sensor to continuously measure and respond to temperature and humidity changes.

* 💨 **Cooling & Ventilation System**
  Includes **2 fans** — one for cooling and one for air renewal.

* ❤️ **Heart Rate Monitoring**
  Integrated **heart rate sensor** tracks infant vitals in real time.

* 📐 **Bed Angle Monitoring**
  An **ultrasonic sensor** detects changes in the bed angle and activates a **buzzer** to alert nurses if adjustment is needed.


## 🛠️ Prototype Development

This system uses the **Arduino Uno** microcontroller as its processing core, connected to:

* DHT11 sensor
* Heart rate sensor
* Ultrasonic sensor
* 2x Fans
* Buzzer
* LEDs
* Breadboard, jumper wires

Together, these components form a functional hardware prototype for an infant incubator.


## 📊 Data Visualization

An interface built with **React** and **Python** displays:

* 🔵 Live temperature and humidity readings
* ❤️ Real-time heart rate data
* ⚠️ Alerts for:

  * Overheating
  * Bed angle anomalies


## 💻 Technologies Used

* 🐍 Python (Backend & sensor data handling)
* 🧬 React (Frontend UI)
* 🖼️ HTML & CSS (UI layout and design)
* 🔌 Arduino IDE (Embedded programming)
