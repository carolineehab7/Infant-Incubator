# Infant-Incubator
This project details the development of a sensor-based system designed to simulate an infant incubator.

## Key Features:
- Temperature & Humidity Monitoring: Using the DHT11 sensor, we were able to detect the temperature and the Humidity and take corrective action
- Cooling & Ventilation system: Used 2 fans, one for cooling the incubator and the other to renew the air
- Heart Rate Monitoring: Used a heart rate sensor
- Bed angle checking: Used an Ultrasonic sensor to check if the bed angle has changed and alerts the nurse by a buzzer.


## Prototype Development:
The project utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller as the central processing unit, along with a DHT11 sensor, a heart rate sensor, ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, a buzzer, jumper wires, and a breadboard to create a functional prototype.

## Data Visualization
A software using React and Python is used to show the temperature, humidity, and heart rate. It was also used to show alerts when the temperature is high and if the bed angle needs adjustments.

## Technologies used
- Python
- React
